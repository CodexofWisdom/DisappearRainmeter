# DisappearRainmeter
Dissappearing Rainmeter menu.

You will have to change most path locations.

Please report any major bugs.

I am aware that the menu will not appear in monitors left of the primary. I believe it to be a limitation of MouseXY. If you find a fix (asside from making the far-left monitor primary), let me know!

Keep me updated on any cool changes or additions you make, as well.

Defaults Guide:

First, put the Autohotkey exe into your startup folder. By default, when it's running, your left Windows key will be disabled, and instead open the menu at your cursor's location.

Keep in mind all icons are currently linked to my computer, and may differ for yours, needing to be changed in the code.

The top icon is an internet browser link. It defaults to Firefox.

The right icon opens a menu dedicated to chat programs. From top to bottom in the menu: Skype, Teamspeak, Mumble, Discord.

The bottom hover opens a game menu. From left to right: GogGalaxy, BattleNet, Steam, Origin, Misc. Left clicking these will open their programs. Right clicking any of these will open their folders. The misc opens a subfolder on hover that currently only contains Minecraft.

The left submenu is for everything else. From top to bottom: LibreOffice, My Computer, GIMP, Settings.

    My Computer submenu defaults are: Downloads, D drive, C drive, Dropbox.
    
    Settings defaults are Power off and CCleaner.
   
Adding icons is just a matter of finding the menu you want in the code and adding a new Meter. You will probably have to play with the positioning. Then just put a new picture in the Images folder and point the Meter to it. Then change the link to whatever you want to go to.

Editing existing icons is even easier. Just change the link and picture.

Adding a new submenu is a bit harder. I would recommend just copy-pasting existing submenu code and fiddling with the positioning.


Feel free to use this code however you like, as long as you give credit to myself and Fawxy (creater or MouseXY) where applicable.


Enjoy!
