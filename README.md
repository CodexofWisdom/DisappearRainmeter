# DisappearRainmeter
Dissappearing Rainmeter menu.

You will have to change most path locations.

Please report any major bugs.

I am aware that the menu will not appear in monitors left of the primary. I believe it to be a limitation of MouseXY. If you find a fix (asside from making the far-left monitor primary), let me know!
